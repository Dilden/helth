# helth app

Helth app aims to be a minimalist web app for tracking calories, sodium, and water intake. It's a PWA built with [`SvelteKit`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte). Your data is your data, which is why once the app loads, none of it is sent back to the server. The only functionality that talks to the server is the barcode scanner. which can magically âœ¨ add items to the daily totals.

## Getting started

+ Clone this [repository](https://github.com/Dilden/helth)
+ `npm install`
+ `npm run dev`

## Building

To create a production version of helth app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`. Helth app uses the node [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) and requires a Node.js backend to fully function.
