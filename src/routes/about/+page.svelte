    <summary class="">What is helth app?</summary>
    <div class="">
      <p>It's super important you know that this application started as a joke. I thought "meme guy" was funny and I also wanted an app to track my water, calories, and sodium intake. At the same time, I was trying to learn about SvelteKit and so, this app was born.</p>
      <p>Being an active kid and young adult meant I never really had to watch what I ate. But after leaving sports midway through college, what I ate very quickly became something I had to think about. For a while, I used other apps to track calories (you know the ones) but after a while, those apps became bloated and full of advertisements which led to me becoming frustrated with them.</p>

    <summary class="">Ok, but who are you?</summary>
    <div class="">
      <p>Oh, right, sorry. My name is Dylan and I like to build web apps. I do some writing about web app development over at https://www.closingtags.com if you're into that sort of thing. </p>

    <summary class="">What data does this app collect?</summary>
    <div class="">
      <p>That's the best part; none! All of the data you save is stored locally on your device. Even the barcode scanner is a connection from your device to the Open Food Facts API so the server doesn't even know what you're scanning. </p>

    <summary class="">I like this project. How can I help make it better?</summary>
    <div class="">
      <p>For real?! Ah, thanks so much. That means a lot to me. The first thing you can do is tell your friends, family, coworkers, acquantences, arch-nemeses, and people on the street about it.</p>
